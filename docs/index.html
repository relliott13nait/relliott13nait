        <h3>Studio Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>The homey atmosphere creates a soothing environment which sets you at ease at once. We are a smaller one room
          studio, which means smaller class sizes and more hands-on instruction, with personal interaction.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Studio Etiquette</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The yoga room is silent before, during and after class. During the class, the instructor is the only one
            speaking. There are some general etiquette guidelines to follow in the studio:</li>
          <li>With respect to those sensitive to fragrances we ask that you refrain from wearing strong scents. We also
            refrain from burning incense.</li>
          <li>We ask you to be mindful of others at the studio if you plan on attending class. Please be on time to
            respect the sacred place of others.</li>
          <li>The instruction is verbal and very technical with no demonstrations. It is very important that you are
            actively listening to the instructor throughout class and allow others the same courtesy.</li>
          <li>There are no shoes in the studio. Please be aware that you’ll be barefoot in the yoga room - any
            contagious foot conditions should be treated as soon as possible or covered/dressed while walking through
            the studio. </li>
          <li>Please bring only your mat, towel, and water into the room. Do not bring purses, wallets, phones or other
            distractions. Due to the heat and humidity in the room, these types of items could be damaged and may pose
            as a distraction.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Something Relaxing</h3>
        <p>Please bring only your mat, towel, and water into the room. Do not bring purses, wallets, phones or other
          distractions. Due to the heat and humidity in the room, these types of items could be damaged and may pose as
          a distraction.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Something Active</h3>
        <p>The flow classes continuously move your body integrating strength and flexibility in a non-stop shift from
          posture to posture. The flow classes vary from slower basic movements to progressively more advanced. We
          support slower movements and believe in the healing aspects associated with the ability to slow down and stay
          present. Our teachers encourage a mindful state to practice from, which supports healing physically,
          emotionally, and spiritually.</p>

      <h2>Spring Yin Workshop</h2>
      <p>It happens every spring. This year’s Spring Yin Workshop will be with Tori Lunden on Saturday, May 13, 2024
        from 2:15pm - 4:15pm.</p>
      <p>After the joy and jubilation of being able to play outside comes the aches and pains in areas we forgot we had.
        It comes as a bit of a shock to our bodies this shift to suddenly gardening, biking, running, hiking, along with
        all the other outdoor activities we love. Even for those that stay active through the winter; the spring is
        often accompanied by stiff muscles and creaky joints.</p>
      <p>This extended practice will help our bodies through this rocky transition with a combination of gentle movement
        and passive, supported stretches for the shoulders, back, and hips. Take two hours to relax and restore so you
        can get on with enjoying our beautiful Edmonton summer.</p>
      <p>This practice is suitable for beginners, experienced students, and especially beneficial for those with active
        lifestyles.</p>

        <h3>About Tori</h3>
        <p>Tori's classes are always a fun and eclectic environment. She delights in teaching people who, like her,
          never thought yoga was something they could do let alone enjoy. Tori has a degree in social work from the
          University of Calgary and has been teaching yoga since 2008; when she would never again work anywhere that
          required her to sit for eight hours a day.</p>
