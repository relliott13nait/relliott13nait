        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
          <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light
            and fluffy.</li>
          <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
          <li>Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the creamed butter and sugar mixture, stirring well after each
            addition.</li>
          <li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
          <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Chilling the dough helps the
            cookies retain their shape while baking and enhances the flavor.</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.</li>
          <li>Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to
            soften slightly.</li>
          <li>Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
          </li>
          <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may still look slightly soft, but
            they will firm up as the cookies cool.</li>
          <li>Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer them to
            wire racks to cool completely.</li>
          <li>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. To maintain their
            freshness, you can also store them in the refrigerator or freeze them for longer storage.</li>
        </ol>
        <aside>Note: Feel free to customize your cookies by adding chopped nuts, coconut flakes, dried fruits, or even a
          sprinkle of sea salt on top.</aside>

      <h2>FAQs about Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>How do I make my chocolate chip cookies soft and chewy?</h3>
        <p>To achieve soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies, make sure to use enough moisture in your dough, such as
          using brown sugar, which contains more moisture than white sugar. Additionally, avoid overbaking the cookies,
          as they will continue to cook slightly while cooling on the baking sheet.</p>
        <h3>Can I substitue ingredients in a chocolate chip cookie recipe?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can make substitutions based on your preferences or dietary needs. For example, you can use
          margarine instead of butter, or a gluten-free flour blend instead of all-purpose flour. However, keep in mind
          that substitutions may affect the texture and taste of the cookies.</p>
        <h3>Can you bake chocolate chip cookie dough from frozen</h3>
        <p>I have tested baking this recipe from frozen more times than I can even count. I have gotten the best results
          when I place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit
          (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough) and put the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating
          time. Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more
          brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.</p>
